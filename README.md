# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

This is a simple machine learning project for sentiment analysis using Python and the Naive Bayes algorithm. The model classifies short English sentences as either **positive** or **negative** based on their emotional tone.

## 📌 Features

- Text classification using `Multinomial Naive Bayes`
- Text preprocessing with `CountVectorizer`
- Trained and tested on a custom-made dataset
- Built in Google Colab using Python

## 🧠 Algorithms & Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- MultinomialNB

## 📊 Accuracy

Achieved **100% accuracy** on the small test set.

## 📁 Dataset

Custom dataset with 10 sample sentences labeled as:
- `1` for positive sentiment
- `0` for negative sentiment

Example:

```plaintext
"I love this product" --> Positive
"This is the worst thing I have ever bought" --> Negative
```

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Run all the cells step-by-step

Modify new_sentences list to test your own sentences!

🔍 Output Example
```
I really love this! --> Positive 😊  
What a horrible experience --> Negative 😠  
This made me so happy --> Positive 😊  
I hate it --> Negative 😠  
```
